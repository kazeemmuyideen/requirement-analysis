# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

### ✅ **Requirement Analysis – Explained Simply**

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting** what a software system should do based on the needs of the stakeholders (like clients, users, and developers).

---

### 🔍 **What is Requirement Analysis?**

It is a **critical phase** in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the **project team understands what the user wants** and how the software should behave.

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of Requirement Analysis**

* To **understand user needs**
* To **define the system scope**
* To **detect conflicts, inconsistencies, and missing information**
* To create a **clear requirement specification** for developers and designers

### 🧩 **Types of Requirements**

1. **Functional Requirements**

   * What the system should do
   * Example: "The system shall allow users to register with an email."

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   * How the system should behave
   * Example: "The page should load within 2 seconds."

3. **Business Requirements**

   * High-level needs from a business perspective
   * Example: "Increase online sales by 20%."

4. **User Requirements**

   * Specific tasks the user needs to perform
   * Example: "User should be able to reset password via email."

### ⚙️ **Steps in Requirement Analysis**

1. **Requirement Elicitation**

   * Collecting needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.

2. **Requirement Specification**

   * Writing clear and detailed requirements in documents (e.g., SRS – Software Requirement Specification).

3. **Requirement Validation**

   * Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders.

4. **Requirement Management**

   * Handling changes in requirements over time.

---

### 📄 **Output of Requirement Analysis**

* A **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document
* Use cases, user stories, diagrams, and models

---

### ✅ **Why It's Important**

* Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers
* Reduces project failure risk
* Ensures product quality and user satisfaction
