# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

### ✅ **Requirement Analysis – Explained Simply**

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of **identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting** what a software system should do based on the needs of the stakeholders (like clients, users, and developers).

---

### 🔍 **What is Requirement Analysis?**

It is a **critical phase** in the software development life cycle (SDLC) where the **project team understands what the user wants** and how the software should behave.

---

### 🎯 **Purpose of Requirement Analysis**

* To **understand user needs**
* To **define the system scope**
* To **detect conflicts, inconsistencies, and missing information**
* To create a **clear requirement specification** for developers and designers

---

### 🎯 **Key Activities in Requirement Analysis**

1. **Requirement Gathering**
2. **Requirement Elocitation**
3. **Requirement Documentation**
4. **Requirement Analysis and Modelling**
5. **Requirement Validation**

### 🧩 **Types of Requirements**

1. **Functional Requirements**

   * What the system should do
   * Example: "The system shall allow users to register with an email."

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**

   * How the system should behave
   * Example: "The page should load within 2 seconds."

3. **Business Requirements**

   * High-level needs from a business perspective
   * Example: "Increase online sales by 20%."

4. **User Requirements**

   * Specific tasks the user needs to perform
   * Example: "User should be able to reset password via email."

## 📘 Use Case Diagrams

### What is a Use Case Diagram?

A **Use Case Diagram** is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that shows the interactions between **users (actors)** and the **system (use cases)**. It helps visualize how users will interact with the application.

### ✅ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Easy to understand
- Captures system functionality from a user's perspective
- Helps identify system boundaries
- Aids communication between stakeholders and developers

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### 📌 What is Acceptance Criteria?

**Acceptance Criteria** are a set of predefined conditions that a software feature must satisfy to be accepted by the client, user, or product owner. They define the **scope**, **expected behavior**, and **boundaries** of a feature from a user's perspective.

---

### 🎯 Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

- ✅ Clarifies expectations between stakeholders and developers  
- ✅ Defines "done" for a feature or task  
- ✅ Helps QA testers verify if a feature meets requirements  
- ✅ Prevents scope creep and miscommunication  
- ✅ Supports better user story writing in agile development

### 🛒 Example: Acceptance Criteria for the *Checkout* Feature

**Feature:** Checkout in Booking Management System

**User Story:**  
_As a customer, I want to complete a room booking and pay so that I can finalize my reservation._

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ The system must allow the user to review their booking details before checkout.
2. ✅ The checkout page must display the total amount

---

### ⚙️ **Steps in Requirement Analysis**

1. **Requirement Elicitation**

   * Collecting needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, observation, etc.

2. **Requirement Specification**

   * Writing clear and detailed requirements in documents (e.g., SRS – Software Requirement Specification).

3. **Requirement Validation**

   * Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, and agreed upon by stakeholders.

4. **Requirement Management**

   * Handling changes in requirements over time.

---

### 📄 **Output of Requirement Analysis**

* A **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document
* Use cases, user stories, diagrams, and models

---

### ✅ **Why is Requirement Analysis Important?**

* Prevents misunderstandings between clients and developers
* Reduces project failure risk
* Ensures product quality and user satisfaction
